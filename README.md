# SURVEY
Routine and repetitive surveys require a sophisticated and structured approach to the execution of the survey and the management and reporting of the survey response data. Designed well, robust and repeatable automated processes can take the grind out of handling survey datasets - improving quality and reducing cost on a daily basis.

Survey Management System (SMS) is a web-enabled application which empowers the development, distributing and analysis of survey forms to improve communication, process management, and decision support across the organization. SMS is suitable for institutes that require surveying and interviewing techniques to measure evaluation amongst different participant's levels and categories.
